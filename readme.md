# Ricardo Portillo Individual Project


This repository will showcase the Individual Project for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class.

### Problem Statement

Imagine standing in front of your fridge or pantry, looking at a variety of ingredients, unsure of what you could make. I myself have been in this situation where I have extra ingredients from a dish I made the other night and am not sure what to make with it. This can sometimes lead to food waste or making the same dish over and over again. 

My idea for this project is to create a Java application where you can select a variety of ingredients from all food groups and it will give you a detailed recipe based on the ingredients that you already have at home. No more wasted food and no more unnecessary stress from thinking about your next meal. The web app will have a friendly UI where users can easily select a wide range of ingredients, create shopping lists for missing ingredients, filter through dietary needs, and browse through a wide range of recipes. All of this is tied into their account.
